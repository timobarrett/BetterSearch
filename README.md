2. open and display top 3 sites containing top incidences of non "stopwords" found
3. write simple text file containing sentences from sites containing non "stopwords"
# Long Term
Apply machine learning tools to improve:
  1. simple text file generated

  3. gain experience with OpenNLP and other tools
